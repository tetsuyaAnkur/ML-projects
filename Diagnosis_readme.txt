Even today in rural India there is lack of proper healthcare facilities. There is lack of doctors with proper medical qualifications.
Rural people consult individuals(living in the village itself) having very basic knowledge of medicines for their healthcare needs.
Due to this many times villagers are not properly diagnosed and have to suffer from severe consequences. So, this project can be used 
to help the villagers to get proper medical treatment. I have used the DECISION TREE (supervised) Machine learning algorithm to classify 
diseases based on their symptoms. Every node of the decision tree is a symptom and it is branched out into 2 branches , one if the symptom
exists and other if it doesnot exist. Nodes at the top of the tree are the most common symptoms(seen in most of the diseases) and as we 
move down the tree the symptoms become more and more disease specific. In this way the height of the tree is minimised. The leaf nodes of
the tree are the probable diseases that the person may be suffering from. So, this can be used by the villagers or the individuals (having
basic knowledge of medicines) . The patient can tell the symptoms he/she is facing and the algorithm will predict a list of probable 
diseases he/she may be suffering from.
