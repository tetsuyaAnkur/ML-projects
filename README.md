# ML-projects
This repository includes some of the ML projects which i have done.
These projects are for beginners trying to learn basics of Machine Learning.
All the implementations will be done in python(2 or 3) and you'll need to install statistical and machine Learning packages.
I have also uploaded the dataset used in the projects.
